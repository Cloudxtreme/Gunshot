     The two included programs, TCMOD and TPMOD were created using
     the unregistered version of MOD-OBJ under Turbo C v2.00 and
     Turbo Pascal v6.0 respectively.   Look at the source code to see
     how they work.


     1. INTRODUCTION
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     The object file that is part of this package allows programmers
     to add music and sound effects simply and easily to their programs.

     Music and sound effects can be played through a large number of
     sound devices, including the PC Speaker, the Soundblaster and
     various Covox devices.  

     Music plays in the background and there are a a huge number of
     ready-made music modules available on the Amiga and the PC (*).

     Music modules are standard Amiga Noisetracker/ Startrekker/
     Soundtracker/ Protracker modules.   A music module is made up of
     up to 31 sampled instruments (instruments can also be things like
     speech samples or effects).   Up to four of these instruments can
     be played at once and are mixed to form the final sound output.  The
     mixing is controlled from a music track,  which can playback notes
     in sequence and perform numerous effects.

     The MODPLAY program (currently MPLAY219B) is a stand-alone player
     for these modules on a PC.  It has graphical support, a real
     spectrum analyser and much more. (And its freeware by Mark Cox)

     The MODEDIT program (currently MODED200) is a module creator/editor
     and the documentation with Modedit explains in more detail the 
     structure of the amiga modules. (also freeware by Norman Lin)

     Please note that not all Music modules can be treated as 'Public
     Domain'.  Each module has a section that lists the names of all the
     instruments and sometimes this includes a message from the author. 
     Use MODEDIT/MODPLAY to view the messages (or use a file viewer on the
     MOD file).  If a module has a message giving the module author, you
     are advised to contact them before using their module for ANYTHING.

     You can obtain modules from many Bulletin Boards,  Internet sites or from
     friends Amiga's.  Modules usually come archived in LZH form, these can be 
     unpacked with the excellent LHA program.  



     2. SUPPORTED PROGRAMS
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
