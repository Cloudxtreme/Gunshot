                  Async Professional BONUS files
                  ------------------------------

These BONUS files are non-commercial units and utilities that
complement Async Professional. These routines were developed by various
authors including us at TurboPower Software. Nearly all of these
utilities require Async Professional to compile. A few require Object
Professional as well.  Nearly all have complete source code, so you can
use them, modify them, or just study them for ideas.

TurboPower Software provides these BONUS files as a free service to our
customers.

TurboPower Software offers no warranty, express or implied, for the
BONUS files. You may use a BONUS unit bearing the TurboPower copyright
within any application that you write, without restriction. Other BONUS
files have either been released to the public domain by their authors,
or are distributed here by their express permission. You may give
copies of the BONUS files to anyone.

If you have a unit or utility that you think would be an appropriate
addition, please let us know.

Each unit/program has been compressed into an LZH file with its
supporting files in order to save disk space. To extract the individual
files, use the supplied LHA.EXE program. From the DOS prompt, enter

  LHA x ArchiveName

For example, LHA x CHECKIRQ.LZH would extract all of the files from the
CHECKIRQ archive.

The section that follows gives a brief description of each of the BONUS
files.

Where appropriate, some BONUS files have been updated and tested for
DOS protected mode operation. The following descriptions indicate
whether the associated files are compatible with pmode by placing
(pmode) after the description.

PATCH.EXE
  TurboPower Software now provides maintenance updates of its products
  at no charge beyond the cost of a download. "Maintenance updates" are
  defined as those that change the version number by only 0.01. Updates
  of a larger degree must be purchased on disk from TurboPower as
  usual.

  The maintenance updates are provided in the form of a patch script
  generated by Pocket Soft's .RTPatch utility. This utility compares a
  group of files and generates a compressed list of differences in a
  single patch file. This file is processed by a utility named
  PATCH.EXE, which applies the patches to your existing copy of the
  library, thus updating it to the newer version.

PROTDOC
  Contains two documentation files: YMODEM.DOC and ZMODEM.DOC.
  YMODEM.DOC was written by Chuck Forsberg and describes the heritage
  and details of the Xmodem and Ymodem protocols. ZMODEM.DOC, also
  written by Chuck Forsberg, is the official specification of the
  Zmodem protocol.

RMTCTL
  A remote control facility that allows a remote program to control a
  host machine (similar in purpose and function to the shareware
  program DOORWAY).

SCRIPT
