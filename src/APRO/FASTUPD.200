It is of interest primarily to Fast Update Plan subscribers.

New Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides an overview of the new features in Async
Professional version 2.0. It also describes a few changes that might
impact your Async Professional 1.x programs.

Async Professional now provides fax capabilities. You can convert
text, PCX, and TIFF documents to fax format. You can display and print
received fax files, and even convert them to PCX. The fax send and
receive units are modeled after the protocol units, with a similar set
of features and user hooks. Async Professional supports Class 1, Class
2, and CAS send and receive faxmodems. See Chapter 10 for a complete
description of the fax facilities.

Another new feature of Async Professional version 2.0 is DOS protected
mode DLLs. Using Borland Pascal 7.0, you can compile Async
Professional to a series of DLLs rather than directly linking the
code. Naturally you are free to distribute the DLLs with your
applications. See 2.F for more information on protected mode DLLs.

Two new device layer units were added. APFOSSIL provides support for
FOSSIL device drivers. APDIGI14 provides support for DigiBoards using
the DigiBoard XIDOS5.SYS device driver. The bonus DigiBoard unit from
early versions of Async Professional is gone because APDIGI14 works
with a much wider set of DigiBoard products. These changes first
appeared in Async Professional 1.10 and 1.11. They are now also
documented in the manual (see 4.D and 4.E).

Buffer information and software/hardware flow control functions were
moved to the device layer from the interface layer.

The protocol layer of Async Professional now includes the CompuServe
B+ protocol. The architecture of B+ closely matches that of other
Async Professional protocols. The B+ bonus unit is gone, although the
GIF support remains in the bonus archive GIFDEMO.LZH. See 7.H for a
description of the B+ protocol.

All file transfer protocols now support the background model, which
permits multitasking the protocols with another process in your
program or writing true background protocol TSRs. See 7.C for more
information on background file transfers.

The ZIP and LZH units now support compression in addition to
decompression. ZIP 1.x implode compression is supported. On the LZH
side, support was added for both compression and decompression of LHA
2.x files. The compression units are documented in Chapter 11.

If you are upgrading from version 1.x of Async Professional, you will
notice a few changes. The biggest change is that Turbo Pascal 6.0 is
now required. This is because many of the new routines take advantage
of features that are available in Turbo Pascal 6.0 and later.

If you wrote a device layer using Async Professional 1.03 or earlier,
you need to add some additional core functions in the area of buffer
information and flow control. See 4.G for more information on the
core routines.

A misnamed public identifier was changed: NoAbortProc was renamed to
NoAbortFunc.
