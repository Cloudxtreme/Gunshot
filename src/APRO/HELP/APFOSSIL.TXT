Port options that are used for Fossil ports only. See 0843Port Options in
APPORT for descriptions of the port options that are used for all device
layers.

Some FOSSIL drivers have a bug where 0268OutBuffUsed sometimes does not drop to
zero when the output buffer is empty (the driver information field diOutUsed
is one when it should be zero). When ptHandleFossilBug is set, APFOSSIL
automatically sets OutBuffUsed to zero whenever it returns one. You should
be aware of this behavior whenever checking for empty output buffer values
in your program. Note that X00 has the bug, BNU does not. ptHandleFossilBug
is on by default since this behavior is not harmful, even with a driver that
does not have the bug.

ptTrueOutBuffFree tells the FOSSIL device layer whether the function
0269OutBuffFree should return the actual amount of free space in the output
buffer, or an indication of whether more data should be sent to the FOSSIL
driver. If ptTrueOutBuffFree is on, OutBuffFree returns the actual amount of
free space in the FOSSIL output buffer. If ptTrueOutBuffFree is off (as it
is by default), OutBuffFree returns either 0 (if the output buffer is less
than 90% free, meaning don't send any more data to the FOSSIL driver) or
65535 (if the output buffer is at least 90% free, meaning it is OK to send
more data to the FOSSIL driver).

ptTrueOutBuffFree is off by default because most FOSSIL users tend to use
small (256 or 512 byte) FOSSIL buffers. These small buffers can cause a
problem because the Async Professional file transfer protocols wait until
OutBuffFree returns a value large enough to hold an entire block. Since a
block could be as large as 2078 bytes, the protocol might wait forever. You
can turn ptTrueOutBuffFree on if you use FOSSIL buffers of 2078 or greater.
Then the actual amount of free space will eventually get large enough for
the largest possible block.

ptPutCharWait tells the FOSSIL device layer to use "wait" transmits when
transmitting data. This option is on by default since most FOSSIL users use
small FOSSIL buffers (256 or 512 bytes) and it is possible for file transfer
protocols to overflow such small buffers. If you are using large FOSSIL
buffers, you can turn this option off and ptTrueOutBuffFree on.

Note that using the default options (ptTrueOutBuffFree not set,
ptPutCharWait set) may cause problems when trying to use the file
transfer protocols in background mode since the FOSSIL driver will
sometimes wait to transmit a block of data. If you want to use background
file transfers, you *must* provide a FOSSIL output buffer of at least 2078
bytes and you must turn off ptPutCharWait.

!TOPIC 543 ValidLineStatus
!NOINDEX
const
  ValidLineStatus : Byte = $03;

Mask for valid line status bits. Most FOSSIL drivers return only bit 0 (data
ready) and bit 1 (overrun). Due to this shortcoming, the following interface
layer routines are not accurate for the APFOSSIL device layer:
CheckLineError, CheckLineBreak, CheckTE, CheckTHRE, and CheckFIFOError. If
you are confident that your FOSSIL driver reliably returns other line status
bits, you can adjust ValidLineStatus to account for those bits.
;

!TOPIC 544 ValidModemStatus
!NOINDEX
const
  ValidModemStatus : Byte = $80;

Mask for valid modem status bits. Most FOSSIL drivers return only bit 7
(Data Carrier Detect). Due to this shortcoming, the following interface
layer routines are not accurate for the APFOSSIL device layer: CheckCTS,
CheckDSR, CheckRI, CheckDeltaCTS, CheckDeltaDSR, CheckDeltaRI, and
CheckDeltaDCD. If you are confident that your FOSSIL driver reliably returns
other line status bits, you can adjust ValidModemStatus to account for those
bits.
