!TOPIC 377 Digi14 port options
!NOINDEX
const
  ptReadWriteWait     = $8000;
  ptClearFlow         = $4000;

Port options that are used for DigiBoard ports only. See 0843Port Options in
APPORT for descriptions of the port options that are used for all device
layers.

ptReadWriteWait, when set, causes the PutChar/GetChar routines to wait two
seconds for room in the transmit buffer or wait two seconds for a character
to receive. Generally, there's no reason to wait in either case, so this
option is not set by default.

ptClearFlow, when set, causes the default flow control to be disabled when a
Digi14 port is opened. This may be necessary if flow control was enabled
when the DigiBoard XIDOS5.SYS driver was configured by the DigiBoard
configuration program XIDOSCFG.EXE. If flow control was turned on in
XIDOS5.SYS, then flow control is in operation. However, the Digi14 device
layer doesn't know that flow control is on and it always reports that it is
off. Additionally, while hardware flow control is on, the Digi14 device
driver ignores all requests to set or reset the DTR/RTS lines. If you want
to control these lines yourself, or you want to set and monitor flow
control yourself, then you should set the ptClearFlow option.

We recommend turning on ptClearFlow since it gives you the most flexibility
and visibility over the hardware control lines and flow control in general.
We suspect, however, that most DigiBoard users are used to setting flow
control in the driver and prefer that the program not interfere with those
settings. For this reason ptClearFlow is off by default.
