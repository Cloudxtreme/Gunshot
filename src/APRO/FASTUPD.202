This file summarizes changes made between Async Professional 2.01 and
2.02. It is of interest primarily to recipients of the APR202.EXE patch
file from TurboPower Software's Electronic Maintenance System.

Most of the new features are described in detail in READ.1ST. The
following is a brief description of them, arranged by unit. Minor
enhancements to existing programs and routines are listed here only and
are denoted by asterisks.

General
  * FileMode changed to read/deny none around all file resets
  * compiles with OPRO 1.30
  * added PeekChar/PeekCharTimeout support to APINT14

APFOSSIL
  - added new option ptBufferGetChar

APDIGI14
  - added new option ptBufferGetChar

APPORT
  - added AppendTrace/AppendTraceHex functions

APUART
  * increased active port count to 8

APFAX12/OOFAX12
  - added GetModemClassSupportEx to detect class 2.0 faxmodems
  * saves partial received fax files
  * improved hangup logic after failed fax session
  * added fpWaiting state for class 1 and class 2 modems

COMTEST/COMTESTO
  - added /Q command line option for specifying non-standard IRQs

All fax demos
  - modified to report class 2.0 modems


Bugs Fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------

DPMI
  - SetSegmentLimit throws away status
  - AllocLTDDescriptors can return 0 on failure

APANSI/OOEMU
  - fails with "setmode" strings with multiple default parameters
  - error not returned on some invalid sequences

TERMWIN
  - various visual problems

APTIMER
  - Delay function sometimes incorrect

APUART
  - IRQ chaining was broken in 2.00 and 2.01

APFOSSIL
  - protocols don't work with apRTSLowForWrite option

APCOM/OOCOM
  - could lose line breaks
  - WaitForString could miss a string
  - possible HW flow control lock when using GetBlockDirect

APMODEM/OOMODEM
  - SetModemCmdMode would times out if +++ not echoed
  - GetModemRegister doesn't work
  - AddModemCode doesn't add options properly
  - doesn't work in pmode (APMODEM only)

APABSPCL/OOABSPCL
  - Random protocol receive hangs
  - EstimateTransferSeconds wrong if TurnDelay is large

APXMODEM/OOXMODEM
  - couldn't receive 1K blocks at 300 or 1200 baud
  - ProtocolReceive could get stuck at end of protocol

APKERMIT/OOKERMIT
  - valid received files sometimes discarded
  - lockup when transferring to some hosts

APASCII/OOASCII
  - would miss last few received bytes if stopped by <ESC>

APZMODEM/OOZMODEM
  - uploads to Delphi online service fail

APFAXCVT/OOFAXCVT
  - ignores rest of line after formfeed
  - pad to end of page too short
  - loss of up to 7 pixels during TIFF compression

APFAX12/OOFAX12
  - leaks file handles when fax sessions are aborted
  - class 1 high BPS rates (12000, 14400) don't work
  - doesn't always call error procedure on errors
  - could hang in tfSendPage a while
  - support for low baud not perfect
  - might not receive at 4800 BPS
  - possible 204 on low-memory during InitTextConverter
  - GetModemInfo could return non-zero AsyncStatus
  - possible bad fax sent if cover page only, in class 2
  - CvrF could be uninitialized during a Close call
  - AsyncStatus set to zero after some failures
  - retrain after page not working in class 2
  - can't send via class 1 to some fax machines
  - GetModemClassSupport would classify class 2.0 modems as class 2
  - problem sending APF as cover page only in class 2

APARCHIV/OOARCHIV
  - wouldn't restore default directory in some situations

APZIP/OOZIP
  - ReadString, dReadBuf, Deflate return undefined on BlockRead errors
  - misses CRC error on deflate
  - memory leak when deleting file comment
  - GPF in dLongestMatch
  - file handle leak
  - allows duplicate files in archive

APFAXPRN/OOFAXPRN
  - AsyncStatus sometimes got cleared inadvertently

APLZH/OOLZH
  - memory leak when compressing zero-length files
  - memory leaks in low-memory conditions
  - Create method doesn't initialize compression method
  - can't abort decompress

TPFAX
  - HWFlowEnable was failing
  - downward scrolling could result in displayed garbage or GPF

ZIPX/ZIPXO
  - 32-byte heap leak

ZIPV/ZIPVO
  - runtime error 200 if archive contains a directory
